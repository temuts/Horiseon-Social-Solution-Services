# Horiseon-Social-Solution-Services

## Description

The main motivation behind this project is to learn about the ways in which codes can be made more easy to read by following semantic elements within the HTML code, and to learn about how the best practices in terms of accessibility can be deployed in web pages, and the web development process. 
This project follows the main page upgrade for the Horiseon Social Solution Services to make elements semantic and sequential in the index.html, so that the purpose of each element can be easily deduced by following the elements labelled in the html.index file. This solves the problem of indescribtive elements providing no clear context within the HTML file, and can make further advancements being made to the page easier for future developers.  
The images and icons within the wepage were made more accessible by adding alt tags to each image and icon displayed in the browser which describes the image being displayed. This solves the problem of empty spaces/loss of content when there are issues with images being loaded/displayed, or user accessibility issues, and ensures that more users are able to obtain the information conveyed by the images even if they do not have the recources the phsyically view the images/icons. 
The website title was updated to reflect the webpage more closely, which makes the appearance of the general page and code more professional, as well as assisting the user in organizing tabs, and viewing their browsers. 
I have learnt the importance of the building an HTML code to account for all accessibility levels of users with respect to images and icons, as well as learnt the importance of structure of within an HTML code, through the usage of semantic elements as opposed to <div> elements.
